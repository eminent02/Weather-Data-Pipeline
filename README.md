# Building an Automated Weather Data Pipeline with Airflow: From Ingestion to Data Warehouse
This project aims to automate the collection and processing of real-time weather data through a data pipeline. The pipeline utilizes Airflow, an open-source platform, to orchestrate the workflow from data ingestion to storage in a data warehouse.

## Features
* Integration with OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving real-time weather data.
* Automated data transformation tasks to convert raw JSON weather data into a structured format.
* Utilization of Pandas library for efficient data manipulation and transformation operations.
* Storage of transformed data in CSV format.
* Configuration of AWS S3 to securely store the weather data.
* Loading of transformed data into an AWS Redshift data warehouse for further analysis.
Implementation of error handling mechanisms and logging to ensure pipeline reliability.
* Scheduled execution of pipeline tasks for regular updates and data refresh.
Data quality checks to validate the accuracy and integrity of the transformed data.
## Installation
#### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
####Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
####Set up the necessary configuration parameters in .env file.
## Usage
Ensure that the required dependencies and configuration are set up correctly.
#### Run the main pipeline script:
python pipeline.py
The pipeline will automatically fetch real-time weather data, transform it, and load it into the data warehouse.
Monitor the logs and output for any errors or issues during the pipeline execution.
